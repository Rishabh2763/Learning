How Do Licensing Agreements Work?
Licensing agreements are legal contracts that are written between two parties—a licensor and licensee. The contract stipulates the type of agreement, the length of the relationship, payments and royalties that are due and when, and the extent to which licensing is allowed. Licensing also allows both parties to retain control over certain facets of the deal, including exclusivity and how a product or service is marketed. In essence, the contract lays out the expectations of what is required of both parties.


How Do I Create a Licensing Agreement?
The best way to create a licensing agreement is through a lawyer. By getting professional help, you lay out the proper foundation for a relationship with the other party. If you don't do so, you open yourself up to a lot of financial and legal hurdles.

How Much Is a Licensing Agreement?
The cost to draw up a licensing agreement can cost anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. Going through a lawyer means you'll have to pay an hourly fee. A simple contract may only be a few hours, while a more hefty deal between parties means more details and revisions.

The Bottom Line
If you want to use someone else's property—especially intellectual property—you'll have to ask that party to enter into a licensing agreement with you. You'll probably have to go through a lawyer to ensure that your interests and those of the property holder are safeguarded. You may have to spend some money to get the agreement drawn up, but by doing so, your financial assets and business will be well taken care of and you're guaranteeing that the relationship with the licensor will be smooth.
